You have movies?
You found subtitle from net?

Then playing them, but dissapointed when the subtitle text show late.
This is a simple script to change the timing on subtitle, so you can synchronize the text and the audio.

Usage:
ruby shift_subtitle.rb --delay your_delay_time --file your_srt_file

sample:
You have a subtitle, but the text is late about 30 secon, so how to change the subtitle?
Here is the command:

ruby shift_subtitle.rb --delay -30 --file ice_age.srt > ice_age_fixed.srt


That is :) enjoy watching the movie!
